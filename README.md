## 🔍 Description

CodeBridge supports two user flows: **Students** and **Administrators**. Students can enroll in coding courses using a cart system, submit testimonials, and explore hackathons/events. The administrator view allows posting events and managing content. Built with Tailwind CSS, the design is desktop-first, scalable, and interactive.

This project demonstrates a complete frontend workflow using **React Hooks**, **React Router**, **Axios for API communication**, and **JSON Server** for local backend simulation.
